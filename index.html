    What is the total expense ratio?<br>
    The total expense ratio is the total cost of investment to an investor who invests in an equity fund, mutual fun or an exchange traded fund.<br>
    How to calculate the total expense ratio?<br>
    total expense ratio = total fund costs / total fund Assets<br>
    Example: A new fund have been managed by binary investments. It has the following information regarding it's new fund<br>
    Total fund costs = $38,000<br>
    Total fund assets = $400,000,000<br>
    find the total expense ratio of the new fund.<br>
    To calculate TER we use the following formula<br>
    total expense ratio = total fund costs / total fund assets<br>
    total expense ratio = $38,000 / 400,000,000<br>
    total expense ratio = 9.5%<br>

    The main reason for which TER is important to investors is that it directly affects the returns on their investments.<br>
